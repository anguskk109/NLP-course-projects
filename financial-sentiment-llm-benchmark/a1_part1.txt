 comments:
Llama 3.1 shows variability in performance across the three runs, with accuracy ranging from 72% to 84%. 
It consistently identifies neutral and negative sentiments well, but struggles with positive sentiment, 
as seen in lower recall and precision in some runs. Overall, its performance is inconsistent, particularly in identifying positive sentiment correctly.

Comments: 
Llama 3.1 incorrectly classified the article as neutral because it focused on the objective language used, 
ignoring the implied positive sentiment of increased profits. While the language is factual, 
the significant profit jump conveys a positive business outcome, which should be reflected in the sentiment classification
